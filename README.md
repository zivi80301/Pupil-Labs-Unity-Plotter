# PupilLabs-Unity_Plotter
Unity project which plots data from pupil labs core eyetracker.

To run, download and open in Unity Hub. Open project, navigate to Assets -> Scenes and open 'Sample Scene'. To run, make sure Pupil Core is connected and propperly plugged in (might only be partially plugged in due to crappy USB-C plug). Additionally, ensure either pupil core or pupil service is running and receiving data from the headset.
